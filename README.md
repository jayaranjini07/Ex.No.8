## Exp 8: Reproducing an Image Using Prompts for Image Generation

# Date : 25-09-2025
# Reg. No. 212223060101

## Aim:
To prompt the AI to reproduce a portrait in classic realism as a stylized digital anime version, maintaining the character’s expression and pose

## Procedure:
1.	Analyze the Given Image:
○	Examine the image carefully, noting key elements such as:
■	Objects/Subjects (e.g., people, animals, objects)
■	Colors (e.g., dominant hues, contrasts)
■	Textures (e.g., smooth, rough, glossy)
■	Lighting (e.g., bright, dim, shadows)
■	Background (e.g., outdoor, indoor, simple, detailed)
■	Composition (e.g., focal points, perspective)
■	Style (e.g., realistic, artistic, cartoonish)
2.	Create the Basic Prompt:
○	Write an initial, simple description of the image. For example, if the image shows a landscape, the prompt could be "A serene landscape with mountains and a river."
3.	Refine the Prompt with More Detail:
○	Add specific details such as colors, mood, and time of day. For example: "A serene landscape during sunset with purple mountains, a calm river reflecting the colors of the sky, and a few trees along the shore."
4.	Identify Style and Artistic Influences:
○	If the image has a particular style (e.g., impressionist painting, realistic photography, minimalistic), include that in the prompt. For example: "A serene landscape in the style of a watercolor painting with soft, blended colors."
5.	Adjust and Fine-tune:
○	Refine the prompt further by adding specific instructions about elements like textures, weather conditions, or any other distinctive features in the image. For example: "A serene landscape during sunset with purple mountains, a calm river reflecting the colors of the sky, a few trees along the shore, and soft, pastel tones in the clouds."
6.	Generate the Image:
○	Use the crafted prompt to generate the image in a text-to-image model (e.g., DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, MidJourney).
7.	Compare the Generated Image with the Original:
○	Assess how closely the generated image matches the original in terms of colors, composition, subject, and style. Note the differences and refine the prompt if necessary.
## Tools/LLMs for Image Generation:
●	DALL·E (by OpenAI): A text-to-image generation tool capable of creating detailed images from textual prompts.
○	Website: DALL·E
●	Stable Diffusion: An open-source model for generating images from text prompts, known for its flexibility and customizable outputs.
○	Website: Stable Diffusion
●	MidJourney: A popular AI tool for generating visually striking and creative images based on text descriptions.
○	Website: MidJourney
## Instructions:
1.	Examine the Given Image: Study the image to understand its key features—objects, colors, lighting, composition, and any stylistic choices.
2.	Write the Basic Prompt: Start with a simple description of the primary elements in the image (e.g., "A sunset over a mountain range").
3.	Refine and Add Details: Improve the prompt by incorporating specifics like colors, shapes, textures, and style (e.g., "A sunset over purple mountains, with a golden sky and a calm river flowing through the valley").
4.	Use the Selected Tool: Choose an image generation model (e.g., DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, or MidJourney) and input the refined prompt.
5.	Iterate and Adjust: If the initial result isn't quite right, adjust the prompt further based on the differences observed between the generated and original image.
6.	Save and Document: Save the generated image and document your prompt alongside any observations on how the output compares to the original.

## AI tool used: DALLE.E

## Deliverables:
### 1.	The Original Image: Provided image for reference.

### 3.	Prompts Used: The text prompts created during the experiment.

  "Convert this classic realism portrait into a stylized anime digital artwork. Keep the character’s original expression, facial features, and pose the same. Render in vibrant anime style with clean line art, smooth shading, and expressive eyes. Maintain the character’s recognizable identity while adapting the colors and details to fit anime aesthetics."

### 4. Comparison of original picture to generated image

1. Colors

Original: Deep crimson/red costume with realistic shading and texture. White ornate throne provides strong contrast.

Generated (Anime): Costume color is preserved (vibrant red), but shading is simplified to smooth tones rather than detailed gradients. The throne is white but lacks the depth/texture detail from the original.

✅ Match: Core red costume and white throne maintained.
⚠ Difference: Less texture and realism due to anime flat-shading.

2. Composition

Original: Centered subject sitting on a throne, body posture upright with one leg crossed, arms resting on the throne’s arms.

Generated (Anime): Exact same composition is preserved — character remains centered, sitting with same pose, arrows visible on shoulder.

✅ Match: Pose, position, and throne framing are consistent.

3. Subject (Character)

Original: Katniss Everdeen with braided hair, serious expression, and detailed facial features.

Generated (Anime): Expression is preserved (serious, neutral), hairstyle with braid is consistent. Facial features simplified into anime style — larger expressive eyes, flatter nose, and simplified jawline.

✅ Match: Identity, braid, outfit, expression.
⚠ Difference: Anime stylization reduces realism of face and hair.

4. Style

Original: Photorealistic realism, cinematic promotional poster.

Generated (Anime): Clean anime/manga-style with bold outlines, simplified shading, and expressive eyes.

✅ Match: Intentional stylization achieved.
⚠ Difference: Ornate throne details simplified, armor texture flattened.

### 5. Refined prompt:

"Convert this realistic portrait into an anime-style digital artwork while retaining high costume detail and ornate throne carvings. Maintain strong contrast shading for depth, preserve realistic textures in the armor and throne, but adapt the face and hair into anime aesthetics with expressive eyes. Keep the same pose, braid, and serious expression."

### 6. Refined image generated

## Conclusion:
By using detailed and well-crafted prompts, text-to-image generation models can be effective in reproducing an image closely. The quality of the generated image depends on how accurately the prompt describes the image's key elements. The experiment demonstrates the importance of prompt refinement and iteration when working with AI tools to achieve desired outcomes. With practice, the model can generate images that closely match real-world visuals, which is useful for creative and practical applications.
